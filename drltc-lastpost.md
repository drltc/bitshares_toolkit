drltc's last post
-----------------

I have come to the conclusion that my username is undesirable for a variety of reasons:

- As an I3 team member, it seems rather unprofessional to advertise a dying competitor with every post.
- My name implies an academic credential I do not in fact possess.
- There are plans to make short TITAN names expire some time in the distant future unless a heavy fee is paid, and I do not want to pay it.
- When I generated the owner key for the drltc TITAN account, I did not take paranoid security precautions since I was only planning on being a casual user and occasional contributor.  Now that I am planning to be a 100% delegate, creating a new username gives me an opportunity to better secure my owner key.
- I will be stuck with whatever delegate name I choose, unless I want to pay the fee to register a 100% delegate multiple times.

Notwithstanding the implication of my click-baity post title, I'm merely retiring the drltc username.  I'll still be an I3 team member and continue to heavily participate in the community just like before, only I will have a brand new username!

Here it is:

For websites where this username is not available, I will be:

    theoreticalbts

I have already registered TITAN and forum accounts for both of these names.

To prove the legitimacy of this message, I will sign the sha256 of this message with drltc TITAN account.

When I chose the drltc name, I had no idea Bitshares would be as successful as it has been, or that I'd end up playing such a huge role in this project.  At the time, BitShares was just another interesting altcoin along with Litecoin, Primecoin, Dogecoin, etc.  The new name marks an increased level of maturity for both the project and my contributions to it.  Great things are ahead for BitShares in 2015!
