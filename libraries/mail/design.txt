Every RPC server can server as a potential "mail server" to receive notifications about transactions.

Every Account can publish a list of mail servers that they check for incoming messages / notifications

Mail servers also automatically publish market transaction notifications for the users.

A wallet will check all of their mail servers for new notifications and build up their wallet transaction history.

When the wallet generates a transaction it checks the mail servers that are registered for the account and broadcasts the message to the mail servers, this requires some Proof-of-Work on behalf of the sender.  


1) Why would I host a public mail server?
  a) because I am a delegate and am earning money
  b) because I am hosting a web wallet and have alternative revenue
  c) how do I prevent the system from being used for file sharing?
     i.   by requiring proof of work with each inventory request
     ii.  by requiring proof of work with each message request.
  d) because I am selling an iPhone app?
     i. is this really public or is this authenticated to the App?

2) How is users privacy compromised?
  a) IP of sender & receiver are known to the mail server and tied to account of receiver.
  b) Timing analysis could reveal balances of sender & receiver based upon the subset of balances
    modified around the time of the message.
 
3) How does this operate legally?
  a) All information on the server is public and available to governments
  b) If necessary server can log the IP of everyone who reads or writes a particular account.

4) How can users increase their privacy?
  a) Use the server from a VPN or TOR
  b) Check accounts other than their own 
  c) Delay the broadcast of transaction notifications by a random interval
  e) Share an mail address.
  
5) Why would I host a private mail server?
  a) So that my light-weight apps can get my messages.

Abuse:  To minimize "spam" servers require all published messages to perform a proof-of-work.
